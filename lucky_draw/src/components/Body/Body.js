        <h3> About Us</h3>
        <p> College life is not just about lectures and exams,
             it’s also about the people who make the journey memorable.
              As the saying goes, “Friends are the family we choose for ourselves,”
               and in college, this chosen family becomes our strongest support system.
                They are the ones who share our midnight snacks, late-night study sessions,
                 and endless laughter. Helen Keller once said, “Walking with a friend in the 
                 dark is better than walking alone in the light,” which perfectly captures how
                  true friends make even the hardest times easier. Another beautiful line says,
                   “A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.” 
                   These friendships built in college often last a lifetime, because as the years pass,
                    we realize it’s not just about what we studied, but about who stood beside us during
                     those unforgettable days.</p>
